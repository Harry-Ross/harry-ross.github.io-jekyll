The (longer) write-up for this project can be found [here](/2020-10-05-wave-update).
# The Idea
Wave is a music-sharing social network built with the MERN stack that allows for
the logging and reviewing of albums and singles. You can browse artist/album pages
and has following/follower functionality to allow you to follow your friends.
# The Execution
The project was fully programmed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, React and NodeJS) as
this is the technology stack I am most familar with. The authentication used Json Web Tokens (JWT) 
and the source of the music data was the Last.FM API.
